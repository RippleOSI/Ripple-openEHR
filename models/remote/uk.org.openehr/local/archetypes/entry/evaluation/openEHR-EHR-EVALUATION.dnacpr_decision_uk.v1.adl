			purpose = <"To record the outcome of a clinical decision as to whether cardio-pulmonary resuscitation should be undertaken or not. This is generally referred to in UK clinical guidance as the DNACPR (Do not attempt cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) decision.

This archetype is closely aligned with with the UK Information Standards Board (ISB) standard covering Core Content ">
			use = <"If cardiac or respiratory arrest is an expected part of the dying process and it is the opinion of the senior responsible clinician that attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation would be unsuccessful or the outcome would be unacceptably burdensome for the person, the making and recording of this clinician’s opinion and recommendation for future management should a cardiopulmonary arrest occur, may be made. These are ‘Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation’ (DNACPR) orders. 

Some patients with capacity to make their own decision may refuse attempted cardio pulmonary resuscitation in advance. These decisions have to be registered as part of an advance decision to refuse treatment (ADRT)">
