			purpose = <"To record details of a known or suspected allergy, other adverse reaction, intolerance to a drug or medicinal substance, drug group or trade family group of drugs.

Whilst this is a primarily a record of the adverse reaction event, it should also be regarded as a statement of 'propensity to future similar reactions', intended to appear quite distinctly within systems and to trigger appropriate prescribing decision support.">
			use = <"This archetype is a superset of the HSCIC GP2GP Drug allergy archetype and can be used for GP2GP purposes, with suitable templating to record allergies, intolerances and adverse reactions to drugs and other medicinal substances. This archetype reflects the behaviour of current UK GP systems which make no distinction between the concepts of 'adverse reaction event' and 'propensity to future adverse reaction'.  It is aligned with the RCP 'core headings' definitions for allergy recording.

It is designed primarily for use with in a UK primary care context but may be suitable for use within secondary care, particularly where the prime requirement is to record propensity to adverse reactions to drugs and other medicinal substances for decision support purposes.">

			misuse = <"This archetype is not designed to support adverse reaction reporting requirements e.g 'Yellow Card' scheme.
It should not be used to record negated statements such as \"No history of adverse reactions\" or \"Allergy to Penicillin refuted by challenge testing\". A specific 'Exclusion of adverse reaction' archetype is used for this purpose to ensure that negated statements are clearly separated from positive statements.

It should not be used to record 'absence' statements such as \"No information available on adverse reactions\" . A different 'Absence of information' archetype is used for this purpose to ensure that 'absence' statements are clearly separated from positive statements.">

Drug Group (SNOMED-CT),
dm+d VMP/AMP (dm+d), 
Ingredient (SNOMED-CT),
 TradeFamily/TradeFamilyGroup (SNOMED-CT).
 It is MANDATORY that one and only one of these must always be selected. Optionally, in addition a SNOMED AllergyCode may be sent as a mapping, but can never be sent on its own. 
For legacy use other codes are permissible such as FDB Agent codes, EMIS Drug codes and READ codes but these should be carried as simple free text and the coded information carried in mappings/translation attributes. This kind of coding is not regarded as being safe to trigger decision support outwith the native GP system.
The exact subset definitions have not yet been agreed and may change prior to full implementation.">
