The 6 Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6CIT) has been found to be a valid screening instrument for detection of dementia (Brooke & Bullock, 1999).
The 6CIT is brief and easy to administer and score.
It is now widely used by Primary Care Physicians in the UK and internationally.
Its primary use is as a 'Recognition tool' to help identify people who should be referred on to a 'Memory Clinic' for more specialist investigation.">
