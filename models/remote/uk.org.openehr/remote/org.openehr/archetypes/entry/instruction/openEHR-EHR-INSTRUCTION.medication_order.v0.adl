It is intended to be used for any type of medication and related order, whether prescribed by a health professional or available for purchase 'over the counter'. The scope of this medication archetype also includes orders for vaccinations or other therapeutic goods, such as bandages, nutritional products or other items that are applied or administered to have a therapeutic effect and which have a common pattern for data recording.

This archetype is designed to be used in a number of clinical contexts, including but not limited to:
- a record in a clinical consultation (COMPOSITION.encounter); 
- a written prescription by a physician, dentist, nurse practitioner, or other designated health professional for a medication to be dispensed and administered (within a COMPOSITION.prescription);
- an item in a current medication list, prescription or drug chart (within COMPOSITION.medication_list); and
- an item in a summary document such as transfer of care (COMPOSITION.transfer_summary) or a referral (COMPOSITION.request). 

It should be noted that these uses subsume both the FHIR Medication Order and Medication Statement use cases. i.e this archetype is a match for both FHIR resources, used in the appropriate context.
 
In most cases the order will be simple - for a single item with uncomplicated instructions for dispensing and administration. However this archetype is also designed to allow for more complex orders. For example:
- a reducing dose of predisolone over a period of weeks;
- titration of insulin, with dosing dependent on test results;
- multiple medications prescribed simultaneously as part of a single drug regimen, such as a triple therapy for peptic ulcer; and
- intravenous administration of medications or nutrition supplements.

This archetype is also suitable for ordering fluids, particularly parenteral fluids, in care settings where it is normal practice to make these 'prescribable' items.  In other settings a separate 'fluid order' may be appropriate.

The archetype has been designed to allow for a range of complexity, from:
- simple narrative instructions for orders like 'furosemide 40mg two tablets in the morning and one at lunch' to ensure compatibility with existing systems; through to
- structured detail for dose, route and timing to represent a fully computable specification.

It has also been designed so that a single medication order structure can represent:
- complex sequential medication orders using the same preparation strength to be supported within a single order structure; and
- multiple medication orders can be chained in circumstances where different medications or preparations need to be given sequentially. 

The amount of the medication is usually represented in terms of a number and corresponding dose unit, however there can also be a narrative statement to ensure compatibility with existing systems and also coverage of all scenarios.

Cluster archetypes have been used to represent some of the content for two reasons:
- in situations where the content has been identified as being also used in other clinical contexts, in particular the paired ACTION.medication archetype for recording actual dispensing, administration etc; and
- to remove less commonly used content from the core archetype framework.

Multiple orders can be used within this single archetype instance to represent tightly bound orders of different medications. For example: H. pylori therapy when this is not prescribed as a single pack.">
