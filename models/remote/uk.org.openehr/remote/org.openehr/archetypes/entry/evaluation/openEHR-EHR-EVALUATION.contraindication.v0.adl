This archetype should be regarded as a critical archetype by any clinical decision support system testing for any relevant therapeutic precautions as a clinician commences a new treatment, test or procedure for a subject of care.

In the case of medications or vaccines, this archetype complements the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk archetype by identifying other reasons why a medication or vaccine should not be administered, other than an adverse reaction. In view of this, clinical decision support for prescribing should include reference to this archetype plus the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk as part of a safe prescribing process.

It is possible for a contraindication to be created in the record of the subject of care, even though the undesired clinical effect may be on others and not directly on the subject of care themselves. For example: live vaccines should not be administered to individuals who have family members in an immunosuppressed state or actively taking immunosuppressive therapy as the family member may be at significant risk of contracting the infectious disease.

This contraindication may be identified in a number of ways including, but not limited to: 
- previous experience of a procedure being performed and subsequent clinical assessment that this should not be repeated; 
- implantation of a metal device which precludes some imaging examinations
- genomic testing results that indicate an adverse event may take place if a treatment or medication is administered; or
- adverse experience by a family member to a similar treatment, medication or procedure.

The 'Absolute?' data element allows refinement of the contraindication as absolute or relative - record as 'Absolute' if the recording clinician regards that there are no reasonable clinical circumstances for the identified contraindication to be administered or performed. Otherwise the contraindication should be regarded as 'Relative' where the recording clinician regards the risk of provision of the clinical treatment, test or procedure may be outweighed by other considerations or mitigated by other measures.">
