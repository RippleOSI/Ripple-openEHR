Use to provide insight into the shape and proportions of an individual's body, usually for purposes of clinical or anthropometric assessment.

The names of the 'Length', 'Circumference', 'Area' and 'Height' measurements have been designed to utilise run-time name constraints which allows for selection of a named body segment to be specified either in a template or at run-time. This archetype contains a number of named measurements modelled as run-time name constraints, but this is not yet a complete list and it is anticipated that the number of measurements will increase over time as additional requirements are identified.

The 'Unspecified Measure' and 'Unspecified Area' data elements have been included to allow for representation of any and all body segment measures, especially where the required measurement has not been included in the run-time name constraints for  'Length', 'Circumference', 'Area' and 'Height' measurements, above. In addition, these less specified data elements allow addiitonal flexibility by enabling naming to occur in templates and at run-time, or through binding to an external terminology, if this is preferred.">
