Different commercial products carry a variety of test /reagent pads. This archetype is heavily influenced by the commonly available Multistix test strips in Australia, recording ten commonly used analytes, but is intended to be generically applicable. If requirements for other parameters become apparent to meet the requirements for other test strips then product-specific urinalysis archetypes may need to be developed.">
